      <h3><b>New Design, New Title, New Launch: My 2020 CHI Project in 2021</b></h3>
      <h5>By: Kyeesha M. Wilcox, <span class="w3-opacity">April 30, 2021</span></h5>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-container">
      <p><b>Note:</b> The following blog post describes the newly designed project website launched on April 30, 2021. The Original CHI launch post from May 6, 2020 can be found on <a href="blog.html">the project blog</a>.</p>
      <br>
      <p>From 2019-2020, I participated in Michigan State University's Cultural Heritage Informatics Fellowship. Once I "completed" my CHI project, I wrote on May 6, 2020:<p>
      <blockquote>“This project was definitely a lesson of learning to crawl before walking. I had very grand plans about my project without knowing what it took to actually make one. I am most certain that I have a lot of ‘crawling’ left to do before I walk when dealing with web design and coding, but I am looking forward to it.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>As I strengthen my skills in coding, I would like to restructure the website to match more of the style I was originally aiming to create.
	...
In the upcoming weeks, I would like to find a single page JavaScript template to work on adding this data to and rework this whole project.”</blockquote>
      <br>
      <p>Although I had learned a lot of coding throughout the fellowship, I wished that my skills matched my vision for the project. Well, nearly 52 weeks later, a relaunch has been completed. After the fellowship ended, I balanced learning about HTML, CSS and JavaScript with work responsibilities. I reviewed some of the coursework that Dr. Watrall assigned the fellows before the start of the fellowship in 2019. Additionally, I completed the 300 hours of freeCodeCamp's coursework for the Responsive Web Design certificate program. After learning more about web design, I drew up a new plan for how I would present my research on Nashville's Great Flood of 2010.</p>
  
      <h3><b><u>Project Description</u></b></h3>
      <p>Nashville, Tennessee experienced one of its most devastating natural disasters in May 2010. A flood tore through the metropolitan area and even some parts of Kentucky and Mississippi. Because that was more than 10 years, so everything must be alright now...right? An answer to this question couldn’t really be found after quite a while of searching. This project emerged as a way to ask that question and many more. After the Great Flood asked how the Metropolitan Nashville Area socioeconomically recovered from the flood, the rate of gentrification in surrounding communities and the changes in racial/ethnic neighborhood compositions after the flood. In this interactive project, viewers can explore photos of the damage, listen to interviews from survivors, learn about the geography of Nashville and see what socioeconomic and racial/ethnic changes occurred in neighborhoods after Nashville’s great flood of 2010. </p>
      <h3><b><u>Website Characteristics</u></b></h3>
      <p>The website consists of (#) pages: 1) the main page housing the project description, visualizations and results, 2) a project blog of new and previous posts, 3) a glossary of commonly used terms for the project, 4) a data and methodology page, 5) a conclusion page and 6) a reference page</p>
      <p>W3Schools supplied the single page HTML templates <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_bw_portfolio.htm">for the website</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_blog.htm">the project blog</a>. All additional pages were customized from either of these templates.</p>

<h3><b><u>Challenges in Relaunching the Project</u></b></h3>
      <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
      
      <p><u>Gaining More Training in HTML and CSS</u></p>
      <p>I storyboarded the website for months and searched templates that fit that vision I had created. Spoiler Alert: I didn’t find the ‘perfect’ template, and when I did find a template I liked, I didn’t understand it in GitHub. So, I kept my storyboards but went back to the drawing board and decided to gain more training in HTML and CSS. I took 300 hours of freeCodeCamp’s Responsive Web Design Certificate Program. Along with the Codecademy courses assigned at the beginning of the fellowship, freeCodeCamp helped me really understand HTML and CSS. I began to understand that with enough experience and training in web design, any template could be customized to match my vision.<p>
      <p>In the beginning of this redesigning project, I explored free template sites like Templated.co, Startbootstrap and HTML5up.net. These sites had very nice designs, but as a beginner, I had some trouble navigating the multiple files in GitHub. W3Schools felt very beginner friendly with the single file templates. I enjoyed that CSS and HTML were in file which took out the complexity that I struggled with from templates from other sites. As I become more familiar with web design and the associated languages and softwares, I hope to create more projects using some of the templates from the sites with multi-page templates.<p>

      <p><u>Color Matching Photos</u></p>
      <p>I wanted to make the design choice to color match every photo used in the project with the sidebar image of the main website. The original template had a black and white photo style, which worked well with the template. When adding the sidebar image of Nashville and flood photos, I was not sure if black and white would work, design wise. With the sidebar and photo gallery, the goal was to show how Nashville looked normally and how the flood damage affected the city. As you can see on the site, I was not able to do this. With more practice in Photoshop, I hope to learn this skill for color matching this project but also future projects.<p>
     
      <p><u>Side by Side Slideshows</u></p>
      <p>The project’s purpose was to compare the 2005-2009 maps to the 2011-2015 maps. Because of the site’s formatting with a sticky left image, finding an image carousel that fit the template was difficult. I really liked the look of <a href="https://freefrontend.com/css-accordions/">accordion carousels</a>, but could not figure out how to code it properly in my site. Finally, after <em>several</em> attempts at finding an image slider, I found W3Schools slideshow slider. At first, I did not know how to code it, but then I was able to resize my maps to fit properly on the site.</p>  

      <br>
      
     <p><b>Resources</b></p>
      <p><u>Beginner-Friendly Website Templates</u></p>
      <p>I found W3Schools Templates to be very beginner friendly. The template is in one html file, so there is no additional CSS file that has to be called. All styling is done right in the index.html.</p>
      <p>As I develop my skills more, I can see myself becoming more comfortable with balancing multiple HTML and CSS. However for now, these templates will work fine for the personal projects that I have in mind. If you are a beginner in web design, W3Schools Templates might be a site to consider for your project.</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p><u>Flourish</u></p>
      <p>I was suggested this platform by another 2019-2020 fellow and have really grown to like it. 
I found a <a href="https://help.flourish.studio/article/155-how-to-embed-two-visualizations-next-to-each-other">recent Flourish blog post</a> that showed me how to place my visualizations side by side in HTML.</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p><u>ThingLink</u></p>
      <p>ThingLink is a tool for adding interactive elements to any image.</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p><u>Accordion Slideshow</u></p>
      <p>I was looking for a slideshow template that 1. could be placed side by side and 2. Allowed for both slideshows to be controlled by the viewer, 3. Have the images be stationary when clicked so both slideshows could be compared at one time.</p>
      <p>The accordion slideshow format excited me the most for its interaction aspect. Viewers had to because the photo gallery was vertical, I wanted the maps gallery to have a different orientation. I searched for an image carousel-type template, but I could not find either what I was looking for or code that I understood.</p>
      <p>I stumbled upon CSS Accordions and loved the look and feel of 
Most of the templates were hover-only and did not allow for viewers to click the image and have it become stationary. I wanted a template that allowed for that specifically so viewers could compare different years of the same type of map. I was suggested Juxtapose from another 2019-2020 CHI fellow but I did not know how to (or if I could) create a slideshow within the Juxtapose and have the slideshow be the before and after time period with little bubbles at the bottom. Because of this dilemma, I had to find a template that allowed me to collect the maps of a certain year together.</p>
