             <dd>A methodology created by Dr. Joe T. Darden and Sameh M. Kamel. The methodology is used to determine the socioeconomic positions of census tracts in a two or three county area. Primarily three county areas have only been investigated. Researchers have used the methodology to identify trends in health outcomes, socioeconomic differences and residential segregation in Metropolitan Detroit. The methodology has not been used to investigate <a href="#nash">the Metropolitan Nashville area</a> prior to this project. 
             
               <p><em>The formula is as followed:</em></p>    
         <p>Where CSIi is the composite socioeconomic z-score index for census tract i, the sum of z scores for the socioeconomic status (SES) variables j, relative to the two-three county/metropolitan area; k is the number of variables in the index; Vij is the jth socioeconomic position (SEP) variable for a given census tract I; VjDMA is mean of the jth variable in the twothree country/metropolitan area; and S(VjDMA) is standard deviation of the jth variable in the two-three county/metropolitan area (Darden et al. 2010). </p>

             <dd>Percent of the population that had at least one vehicle as a means of transportation to work in a given census tract. This neighborhood socioeconomic characteristic is one of the nine socioeconomic variables in the Modified Darden-Kamel Composite Socioeconomic Index. The variable was derived from the American Community Survey (ACS), and its variable name was ‘Means of Transportation to Work by Vehicles Available’. The value was calculated by adding the percentages of the ‘total’ subcategory in a given census tract (equation: 1 vehicle available% + 2 vehicles available% + 3 or more vehicles available%). Alternatively, the same value could have been calculated by subtracting the percentage in >total >no vehicle available from 100%. The other subcategories and their corresponding figures were not included in this variable’s final values (i.e. ‘car, truck, or van - drove alone’, ‘car, truck, or van - carpooled’, ‘public transportation (exclusind taxicab)’, ‘walked’, ‘taxicab, motorcycle, bicycle, or other means’ and ‘worked at home’). </dd>

             <dd>A survey conducted in Nashville and Davidson County. Damage assessment data was collected from residents on the damage to their property or properties. There were four levels of damage to choose from: either minor (1), moderate (2), major (3) or severe to destroyed (4). The data was visualized in an <a href="https://maps.nashville.gov/May2010Flood/">interactive map</a> by Nashville's GIS Department in 2010.</dd>

      <p><em>After the Great Flood</em> asked if the Metropolitan Nashville Area recovered socioeconomically from the flood, about the rate of gentrification in surrounding communities and how racial/ethnic neighborhood compositions changed after the flood. In this interactive project, viewers can explore photos of the damage, listen to interviews from survivors, learn about the geography of Nashville and see what socioeconomic and racial/ethnic changes occurred in neighborhoods after Nashville’s 2010 flood.</p>
